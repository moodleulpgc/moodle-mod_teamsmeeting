Institutional access needs a definite user in o365 with Privileges and Policies applied to manage onlineMeetings across organization tenant.
The Organizer user can update any onlineMeetings created by Teamsmeeting from moodle module instance updated by any course teacher. 
The meeting is thus a course meeting rather than a personal one.  
Teachers are added as Presenters to the meeting and has full presentation capacities during video meeting.  

If courses have only one teacher, and the same user will manage course meetings,
